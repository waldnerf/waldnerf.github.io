François Waldner (aka Franz) is a remote sensing scientist specialised in large area crop mapping and monitoring. I originally hail from Brussels, Belgium.  He is currently finishing a PhD on yearly cropland mapping using high resolution satellite image time series. He also contributes to developing monitoring strategies of the locusts and grasshoppers habitats. He is driven by developing innovative techniques in line with the operational requirements of the application. Recently, he won the Agriculture award of the Data For Development challenge organized by Orange in collaboration with the MIT. He is also involved in several Science policy groups and Open Science initiatives.
